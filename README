This project was started to troubleshoot a problem with default specs generated with "rails g scaffold resource name:string" after rspec has been installed.

Tests all pass even with MongoID... until, it seems, "$ rails generate jquery:install" was run. Then tests broke.

In current state 3 tests will fail. 2 of them can be made to pass by commenting / uncommenting lines (marked in comment).

3rd test (DESTROY) can be made to pass if using a real object instead of the mock.
